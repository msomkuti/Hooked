Accomplished: made a module (hookedfuns.py) to hold all of my functions and classes,
              used import statement

              Dialogue in dictionaries

              11/8/2018:  Text blitting over images, addText function
                          Appending lines of characters is not exiting while loop!

              11/17/2018: Splitting of dialogue stored in conversation dictionaries,
                          so split in clean lines under a certain width threshold

                          Note: It still needs tweaking

                          This is the basis for how text will appear in each message,
                          and will provide the basis for how much a text will have to
                          extend vertically for each line of dialogue.

              11/22/2018: Discovered that text adding function still does not work as intended
                          try it with conv_Ashley[5]. . .

                          Started the bubble draw function, need to make it draw correctly
                          Modified add_text so it found coordinates for each line of text

                          Note: I really need to start working with more surfaces. There are some
                          fundamental design flaws in this program that I need to address due to
                          this. Start version control ASAP!!!

              11/23/2018: Made is so the background of each chat is now initialized as a surface when chat bubbles
                          are instantiated. Chat bubbles surfaces will now be drawn in relation to the dimensions of
                          the window size.

                          Note: There is a fundamental design change here. I want this to look more like a natural text
                          conversation, so I will be blitting lines of dialogue one by one beneath each other, instead
                          of side by side.

                          This surface, chat_bg, is dynamic! Before going into this, I want to note
                          that I finally fixed the slicing of each line of dialogue in addtext(). This is now
                          dependent on the max size of chat_bg. However, when the dialogue is sliced into lines of
                          text, chat_bg scales to the total length of the lines when they are rendered. I.E. when a
                          entry of dialogue is split into 5 lines of strings, chat_bg will scale height wise
                          (and length wise if there is only one line of short text) to the to the sum of all all 5
                          strings heights + line spacing.

                          Also, lines of text now have correct spacing, I.E. "Exampleoftxt" renders as "Example of txt"

                          Note: Margins for the lines inside of chat_bg are still a bit wonky, but the current version
                          works decently (including line spacing).

                          Note: For some dialogue entries, the width of chat_bg changes after scrolling

                          Note: There is no dialogue that would be split into enough lines that would their collective
                          height be greater than the maximum height of chat_bg, but I should establish an error catch
                          nonetheless. . .

                          11:49 PM: I made it so now each character's bubbles are made via iteration. However, the
                          scroll function and blitting them to the screen only works well when each bubble object is
                          made separately and stored in variables. . .

                          When made separately, I can blit multiple bubbles to the screen and have them spaced nicely.

                          Note: I will make bubble spacing dynamic as well later

              11/25/2018: Title screen now generated from function in hookedfuns.py. Chat bubbles for each character are
                          now generated dynamically as an array of objects reliant on the number of keys in the dialogue
                          dictionary for each character. Each bubble is also now initialized with its respective
                          dialogue entry as self.text rather than inputting it into the scroll function.


Next: Make text rectangles rounded

      Ensure that margins are being generated correctly

      Fix scaling of chat_bg

      Animate text scrolling in function

      Create conditional to stop blitting of bubbles off screen
